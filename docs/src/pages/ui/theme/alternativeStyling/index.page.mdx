One of the goals of amplify is to be a good citizen of the environment it exists in. As such amplify works hard to not interfere with other tools that are being used.

## CSS In JS

There are many CSS in JS libraries out there that give a number of benefits. Amplify does not use a CSS In JS library to implement its theming system but operates well with the major CSS In JS libraries out there. Below are a few of the CSS In JS libraries out there and a description of how they interact with amplify's theming system.

<BlockSwitcher>
<Block name="Styled Components">
[Styled Components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) allows you to create visual primitives with actual CSS code directly tied to components.

### Usage

```
import styled from "styled-components";
import { View } from '@aws-amplify/ui-react';

const StyledView = styled(View)`
  background-color: black;
  font-size: 32px;
`;
```
