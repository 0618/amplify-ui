## tabs Props

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| TabsSpacing | 'equal' &#124; 'relative' | - |
| children | React.ReactElement &#124; React.ReactElement[] | 
The Tabs component only accepts TabItem components as children. |
| defaultIndex | number &#124; string | 
Change which Tab content is initially displayed. Pass in the index of the Tab you wish to show. The default is index 0 (the first tab). |
| currentIndex | number &#124; string | 
The controlled index of the currently selected tab. This should be used with
&#96;onChange&#96; as well to make the component controlled. |
| onChange | (value: number &#124; string) =&#62; void | 
For controlled usage, use the onChange event to listen to when a tab is clicked
and update the &#96;currentIndex&#96; accordingly. The index of the tab clicked is passed
to onChange. |
| spacing | TabsSpacing | 
Control how Tabs take up the remaining space. Pass &#96;equal&#96; to make each tab take up the same amount of space,
and &#96;relative&#96; to make each tab take up space relative to the size of its title. |
| indicatorPosition | 'top' &#124; 'bottom' | 
Sets the border and indicator of the tabs to be the top or bottom. |
| title | React.ReactNode | 
Change the title corresponding with each Tab's content panel. |
| isDisabled | boolean | 
Make a Tab not clickable and its content not visible to the user. Defaults to false (i.e., visible). |
