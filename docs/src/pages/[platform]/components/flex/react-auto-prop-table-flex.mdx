## flex Props

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| direction | ResponsiveStyle&#60;Property.FlexDirection&#62; | 
Sets how flex items are placed in the flex container defining the main axis
and the direction (normal or reversed). (maps to flex-direction CSS property) |
| wrap | ResponsiveStyle&#60;Property.FlexWrap&#62; | 
The flexWrap property is set on containers and it controls what happens when
children overflow the size of the container along the main axis. By default,
children are forced into a single line (which can shrink elements). If
wrapping is allowed, items are wrapped into multiple lines along the main
axis if needed.
