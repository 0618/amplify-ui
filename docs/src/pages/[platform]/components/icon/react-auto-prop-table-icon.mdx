## icon Props

| Name | Type | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ----------- |
| IconSize | Sizes | - |
| minX | number | - |
| minY | number | - |
| width | number | - |
| height | number | - |
| pathData | string | 
This defines the shape of the &#60;path&#62; SVG element(the 'd' attribute). |
| ariaLabel | string | 
This is used to define a string that labels the current element. |
| viewBox | ViewBox | 
This defines the position and dimension, in user space, of an SVG viewport. |
| fill | Property.Color | 
By default this will be "currentColor" to match what is generally expected
of icons (they inherit their color from current font color). |
| children | React.ReactNode | 
You can pass SVG elements like &#60;path&#62; directly as children for more
flexibility and to allow for multiple paths. |
| paths | Array&#60;React.SVGAttributes&#60;SVGPathElement&#62;&#62; | 
Optionally pass an array of path-like objects which
the icon will map to &#60;path&#62; elements. |
